The Geolocation API of JavaScript is used to get the geographical position or location of a user.  Using this API, you will get the current latitude and longitude coordinates of the user if they allow it. In this small project (Get User Location in JavaScript), on the webpage, there is a button labeled as “Detect your location”.
